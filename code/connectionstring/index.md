# Database ConnectionString
WorkplaceX framework manages two sql ConnectionString.
* Application (Database for business data)
* Framework (Database for framework related data)

Typically, both ConnectionString point to the same database. However, to demonstrate the frameworks capabilities on existing databases it is possible to define a ready only ConnectionString to the Application database.
