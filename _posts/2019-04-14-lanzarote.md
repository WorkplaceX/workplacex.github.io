Traveling to Lanzarote island starting at the Lanzarote Airport (ACE)

Lanzarote is an island off the coast of West Africa and belongs to Spain. The largest town Arrecife can be reached from the Lanzarote Airport (ACE) by car in about 15 min. It's located by the ocean. For an excellent view it's worth it to stop by for a coffee at the "Arrecife Gran Hotel & Spa" on 17th floor.

Recommendable is also a stop at "Arrecife bahía" which is a bay with many small fisher boats. It reachable by foot in about 20min. Generally, it seems to be less windy since it is located kind of in a lee which makes it quite comfortable.

If you like to walk there is a nice and long promenade from the city along the ocean to the airport without cars. Access to the airport is not possible from this side though.
