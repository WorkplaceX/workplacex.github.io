With NuGet it is possible to package and distribute content files similar to npm package manager. The following steps show how to add and consume a content folder.

In the (\*.csproj) add the following three of code. It adds MyContent folder to the class library.
```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <None Include="MyContent\**" Pack="true" />
  <Content Include="ClassLibrary.targets" PackagePath="build\ClassLibrary.targets" />
</ItemGroup>
```

Add a new file ClassLibrary.targets. It defines where to extract MyContent folder in the consuming application.

```xml
<Project xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
    <ItemGroup>
        <SourceScriptFiles Include="$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)..\content\**" />
    </ItemGroup>
    <Target Name="CopyScriptsToProject" BeforeTargets="Build">
        <Copy SourceFiles="@(SourceScriptFiles)" DestinationFolder="$(ProjectDir)MyContent\" />
    </Target>
</Project>
```

Then create the package by running Pack.
