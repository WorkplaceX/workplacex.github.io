# Web Application Framework
WorkplaceX is an open source framework simplifying business application development. It's great to build administrative software. Build modern web applications accessing SQL databases. The framework provides APIs with the following core functions "out of the box":

* Data grids (high performance with millions of records and hundreds of columns)
* Paging (horizontal and vertical), sorting, filtering
* Lookup window and autocomplete function
* Master detail relations
* Modern looking browser web front end (desktop and mobile)
* Data access to SQL server and/or memory
* Multilanguage support
* Configuration

It standardizes and simplifies the process of building enterprise business applications on top of existing SQL Server Databases. It can be hosted on premise or in the cloud and is based on the following products:

* ASP.NET Core 2.1
* Bootstrap 4
* Angular 6 (Also server side rendering for high performance first page load)

Allow thousands of users to access and manage your companies data in a controlled manner. Be flexible and evolve business models as the marked changes.
