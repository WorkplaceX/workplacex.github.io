# Application Framework
WorkplaceX is an open source framework providing a modern user interface and helping businesses to simplify the application development process. The framework provides the following functions "out of the box":

* Web browser front end (desktop and mobile)
* Data grids (high performance with millions of records and hundreds of columns)
* Paging (horizontal and vertical), sorting, filtering
* Autocomplete function
* Master detail relations
* Data access to SQL server or/and memory
* Field look up windows
* Multilanguage support
* Configuration

It standardizes and simplifies the process of building enterprise business applications on top of existing SQL Server Databases. It can be hosted on premise or in the cloud and is based on the following products:

* ASP.NET Core 2.1
* Bootstrap 4
* Angular 6 (Also server side rendering for high performance first page load)

Allow thousands of users to access and manage your companies data in a controlled manner. Be flexible and evolve business models as the marked changes.

Deliver complex web applications very fast, without having to touch Html or JavaScript. The framework fully supports continuous integration (CI) and optimizes development cycles.
